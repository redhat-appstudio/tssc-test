# UI Tests Design

## Overview

The UI Tests for RHADS SSC are designed to test the web pages user can access. They validate the information shown in the UI and check that all required information is shown properly.

## Design

### How are UI tests integrated to a testing pipeline

High level test flow used in a CI is described in a picture:

### What are UI tests testing

UI tests run after a successful backend E2E test. UI test then opens an appropriate component in the UI and checks the relevant features based on the component setup. For the release testing, it is required to test all combinations of RHADS setup and templates. To save time, the UI tests run in parallel, same as the backend tests.

## Running Tests
To run the test, a user has to be logged in the cluster in a terminal that runs the tests. The project configuration files have to be present (either generated by `npm run generate-config` or created manually). Logs, screenshots and videos are generated and saved to `playwright-report` folder.
