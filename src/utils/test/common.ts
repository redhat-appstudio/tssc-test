 * Promotes an application to a specific environment using a pull request workflow
 *
 * This function implements a GitOps promotion workflow by:
 * 1. Creating a promotion pull request in the GitOps repository for the target environment
 * 2. Waiting for any CI validation pipelines triggered by the PR to complete successfully
 * 3. Merging the PR once validations pass, which triggers deployment
 * 4. Syncing the ArgoCD application to deploy the changes to the target environment
 * 5. Waiting for the application to be fully synced with the new configuration
 *
 * The function handles error cases and provides appropriate error messages when
 * any step in the process fails.
 *
 * @param git - Git provider instance for interacting with repositories
 * @param ci - CI provider instance for monitoring pipeline execution
 * @param cd - ArgoCD instance for managing deployments
 * @param environment - Target environment to promote to (e.g. 'dev', 'stage', 'prod')
 * @param image - The container image URL to deploy to the target environment
 * @returns Promise that resolves when promotion is complete
 * @throws Error if any step in the promotion process fails
